## Installation

This project uses Ruby, before installing the `coinpare` tool, you'll need to ensure Ruby is installed on your machine.

In your terminal execute `ruby` command with `-v` option:

```
$ ruby -v
```

If you have version of Ruby greater than `2.0.0` then you're good to go.

Otherwise, please follow [Installing Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#apt) to pick best installation method.

Once Ruby is installed, install the `coinpare` gem:

```
$ gem install coinpare
```

And then execute `coinpare` to see all available options:

```
$ coinpare
```

![Interface](https://github.com/piotrmurach/coinpare/raw/master/assets/coinpare_interface.png)

## View coins

You can see top 10 trading info (price, volume, open, high, low etc) of any cyptocurrency in any other currency by running:

```bash
$ coinpare coins
```

By default, `USD` is used as the base currency price which you can change by passing `--base` or `-b` flag:

```bash
$ coinpare coins --base BTC
```

If you wish to see more currencies use `--top` flag:

```bash
$ coinpare coins --top 30
```

Alternatively, you can specify exactly the coins you're interested in by naming them :

```bash
$ coinpare coins ETH BCH LTC --base btc
```

You can also change the default exchange:

```bash
$ coinpare coins BTC ETH --exchnage coinbase
```

See [view markets](#view-markets) for more information on available exchanges.

Finally, if you want to auto refresh data use `--watch` or `-w` flag:

```bash
$ coinpare coins --watch
$ coinpare coins -w
```

You can watch for changes on your preferred cryptocurrencies:

```bash
$ coinpare coins BTC ETH LTC ZEC --watch
```

By default 5 seconds interval is used which you can change by providing a new value after `--watch` flag:

```bash
$ coinpare coins --watch 20   # every 20 seconds
```

## View markets

You can get top markets by volume for any currency pair. By default 10 top exchanges for the BTC and USD pair by their total volume across all markets in the last 24 hours are displayed.

```bash
$ coinpare markets
```

is equivalent to:

```bash
$ coinpare markets BTC --base USD
```

An example output:

To change the pair do:

```bash
$ coinpare markets ETH -b BTC
```

You can specify the number of displayed exchanges with `--top` or `-t` flag:

```bash
$ coinpare markets --top 30
```

To watch for changes use the `--watch` or `-w` flag:

```bash
$ coinpare markets --watch
$ coinpare markets -w
```

## Create portfolio

There is an easy way for you to keep track of all your investments by running `holdings` command.
You will be presented with a prompt that will guide you through the portfolio setup and allow you to add as many
holdings as you wish.

```bash
$ coinpare holdings
```

### Add/remove coins

**Coinpare** allows you to easily add and remove individual coins to and from your holdings portfolio.

To add a coin do

```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
